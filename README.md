# Bacon-Game
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon
Done as a Problem Set in CS10, Dartmouth. The game takes Kevin Bacon (which can be changed) as the center of the acting universe, and aims to find the shortest path between any other actors to the center. It can also suggests the most "connected" people, meaning the actors who have co-starred the most.
